                    \n :blue[**Step 2**]: Download needed packages. Here I mainly use [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
                    \n :blue[**Step 3**]: Create a basic Streamlit app to be familiar with Python and Streamlit
                    \n :blue[**Step 4**]: Choose a dataset you want and analyze the dataset to decide what to draw 
                    \n :blue[**Step 5**]: Use Streamlit and plotly.express to draw
                    \n :blue[**Step 6**]: Run the web app on your laptop (locally) to see if it works 
                    \n :blue[**Step 7**]: If all things go well, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and then a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) account. It is important that you connect your Streamlit account to the Github account.  
                    \n :blue[**Step 8**]: If your app runs smoothly, upload it to Github.
                    \n :blue[**Step 9**]: Once you are done with Step 8, go to your Streamlit account and click on New app
